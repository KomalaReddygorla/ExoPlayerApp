## ExoPlayer
ExoPlayer is an application level media player for Android.It provides an alternative to Android's MediaPlayer API for playing audio and video both locally and over the Internet.
ExoPlayer is an open source project that is not part of the Android framework and is distributed separately from the Android SDK. ExoPlayer’s standard audio and video components are built on Android’s MediaCodec API, which was released in Android 4.1 (API level 16).
Because ExoPlayer is a library, you can easily take advantage of new features as they become available by updating your app.
